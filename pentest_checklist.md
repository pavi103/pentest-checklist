## Checklist

### 1. Reconnaissance

- [ ] **Identify target**: determine the IP address or the URL of the target system.

- [ ] **Domain name research**: use tools like WHOIS and DNS lookup to gather information about the domain.

- [ ] **Network Enumeration**: identify other systems in the same network.

- [ ] **Identify technologies**: determine the technologies used by the target system.

- [ ] **Email harvesting**: collect email addresses associated with the domain.

- [ ] **Social media footprint**: check the target's presence on social media platforms.

- [ ] **Check for subdomains**: use tools like Sublist3r2 or theHarvester to find subdomains associated with the target.

- [ ] **Identify users**: use OSINT (open source intelligence) to identify users associated with the target system.

- [ ] **Physical location**: if relevant, determine the physical location of the server.

- [ ] **Network Topology**: map out the network topology, understand how the internal systems are interconnected.

- [ ] **Identify security measures**: identify any security measures in place, this could include firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

### 2. Scanning

- [ ] **Port Scanning**: identify open ports on a target system.

- [ ] **Network Scanning**: identify active devices on a network.

- [ ] **Vulnerability Scanning**: use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify known vulnerabilities in the system.

- [ ] **Banner Grabbing**: identify the services running on open ports.

- [ ] **Scan for IP addresses**: identify all IP addresses associated with the target system.

- [ ] **Operating system detection**: identify the operating system on a target machine.

- [ ] **Service detection**: determine the services running on a target system.

- [ ] **Version detection**: determine the versions of the services running on a target system.

- [ ] **Web App Scanning**: if the target system is running web application, use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to perform more detailed scan.

### 3. Gaining Access

- [ ] **Exploitation**: use the vulnerabilities identified during the scanning phase to exploit the target system.

- [ ] **Password cracking**: if the system is protected by passwords, use tools like John The Ripper or Hydra for cracking.

- [ ] **Privilege escalation**: once access is gained, try to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system.

- [ ] **Social Engineering**: use the information gathered during the reconnaissance phase to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

- [ ] **Session hijacking**: if the target system uses sessions, try to hijack an active session to gain access.

- [ ] **Spoofing**: try to impersonate another users or device to gain access.

- [ ] **Man-in-the-middle attack**: intercept and alter communication between two parties without their knowledge.

- [ ] **Denial of service**: although not always applicable, sometimes a Denial of Service (DoS) can be used to exploit a vulnerability in the system.

### 4. Maintaining Access

- [ ] **Install backdoors**: once access is gained, install backdoors to ensure future access to the system.

- [ ] **Create privileged accounts**: create accounts with elevated privileges for future use.

- [ ] **Rootkits**: install rootkits to maintain control over the system.

- [ ] **Disable security controls**: disable any security controls that could detect your presence.

- [ ] **Schedule tasks**: schedule tasks or jobs that will re-establish your connection at a later time.

- [ ] **Data exfiltration**: set up methods to exfiltrate data from the target system.

- [ ] **Connect to C&C server**: establish connection to a Command and Control (C&C) server for remote control.

### 5. Covering Tracks

- [ ] **Clear logs**: remove or alter log files that could indicate your activites on the system.

- [ ] **Hide files**: if you've created or altered any files, make sure they're hidden or blend in with other files.
      
- [ ] **Remove tools**: any tools or software you installed on the system should be thoroughly removed.
      
- [ ] **Terminate sessions**: ensure that all connections to the target are properly terminated.
      
- [ ] **Clear command history**: if you've used a command line interface, make sure to clear the command history.
      
- [ ] **Reset modified settings**: if you've changed any settings on the target system, reset them to their original state.
      
- [ ] **Use steganography**: if you need to leave information on the target, consider using steganography to hide it.
      
- [ ] **Use anti-forensics techniques**: use techniques to thwart forensic analysis, such as file wiping.

### 6. Reporting

- [ ] **Executive Summary**: provide a high-level overview of the test, its objectives, and methodologies used.

- [ ] **Scope**: clearly define the scope of the penetration test, including the system that were tested. 

- [ ] **Findings**: detail each vulnerability that was discovered, its severity, and the potential impact on the system.
      
- [ ] **Evidence**: provide evidence to support your findings, this could include screenshots, logs, or other relevant data.
      
- [ ] **Recommendations**: provide recommendations for mitigating each of the vulnerabilities found.
      
- [ ] **Methodology**: describe the methodology used during the penetration test.
      
- [ ] **Conclusion**: summarize the overall state of the system's security and any next steps that should be taken.
      
- [ ] **Appendices**: include any additional information that supports the report.
